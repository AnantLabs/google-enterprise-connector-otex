#summary Database server requirements for supporting various versions of Livelink.

= Introduction =

The connector implementation uses the `LAPI_DOCUMENTS.ListNodes` method, 
which is an undocumented LAPI method. This method essentially takes a 
SQL query and returns a recarray. This method is used for both traversal 
and authorization.

The SQL queries used in the connector are all designed to work with 
SQL Server 7.0 or later, and with Oracle 8i Release 2 (8.1.6). This 
enables the code to work with Livelink 9.0 or later. The exception to 
this is that Sybase, which is supported by Livelink 9.2.0.1 and earlier, 
is not supported here.

= Database Versions =
